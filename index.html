        <h3><a href="projectPage.html?id=1">LocalShirt</a></h3>
        <p>LocalShirt is a web extension that helps its consumers find responsible alternatives to the textile products
          they purchase online.
          <br>
          <br>
          The suggested alternatives offer a more positive environmental and ethical impact. Thus, the user can continue
          to buy products that meet their initial expectations without having to change their consumption habits.
          <br>
          <br>

          Information about the alternative such as price and its ecological/ethical benefits will be presented to the
          user. If the user wishes to purchase a suggested alternative, there will be a redirect button to the website
          where the item is located.
          <br>
          <br>

          To be able to suggest these alternatives, Partner Brands will have the opportunity to collaborate with us. As
          a result, they will have an account that allows them to access the dedicated partner section. This section
          enables them to add and interact with the items they want to propose as alternatives..
